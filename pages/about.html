        <div class="flex-item">My name is Ayomirwoth Peace, and I am a passionate young tech enthusiast.
            My journey into the world of computer science has not been without its challenges.As a young girl,
             I faced stigmatization and stereotypes that perpetuated the unfounded belief that girls can't code.
             However,I am deeply grateful to God that I refused to let these negative narratives define me.
             Instead, I took it upon myself to prove them wrong.I am proud to say that I have learned a great deal and
             am still continuously growing and advancing my skills.
            </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
             I have gained experience in programming, including Python, web design with HTML and CSS, graphic design,
             and data science, among other areas. I am forever thankful to my school, The Women's Institute of 
             Technology and Innovation, for providing me with the opportunity to learn and develop. Most importantly,
             I am proud of myself for not giving up and for continuing to push forward despite the obstacles.
